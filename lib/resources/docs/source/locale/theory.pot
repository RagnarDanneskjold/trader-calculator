msgid "An online betting exchange is a web service where users can, among other things, trade contracts with each other about the outcome of future random events. The pay-off of these contracts can either be some fixed amount of money or nothing at all. The main innovation of this system, compared to traditional bookmakers, lies in providing a method to set fixed odds against an outcome -- known as *laying* -- and invite other users to bet in favour of the outcome -- know as *backing*. This type of freedom had previously been reserved only to bookmakers."

Introduction
------------
This application is a simple tool for users of betting exchanges and 
it is meant to solve the well-known problem of *Bet-Hedging*: 
configure the profit/losses of two bets - a back and a lay bet - for 
all outcomes.

The main objective in its development was to guarantee the 
possibility of using solely the keyboard fast and efficiently. 
Obviously, their exists other solutions of the same kind [1]_ [2]_ 
[3]_ but all have problems: they depend on the web-browser, none 
allows keyboard devotion, amongst others.

This calculator is an open-source project (GPLv2) and 
cross-platform. It is implemented as free software aiming to be 
executed in all platforms supported by wxPython [4]_.

Development
-----------
Suggestions, comments or reviews are welcome! You can send them to filipe.funenga@ist.utl.pt. Also, if you find bugs please create an issue at github [5]_ or send me an email.

The development of this application started in 23/Dec/2012 and has been made in Ubuntu 12.04 with Virtualbox running Windows 7.

In its current state, a macintosh build is not yet available since I have not immediate access to a macintosh machine. But do not worry, deployment to that framework will be done in the near future.
